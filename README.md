# autolaze
Public repository of AutoLaze laser machining software releases. Go to the Releases area to download the installation program for the AutoLaze application.

The repository also implements a small website with a single html file that is deployed to https://github.com/ByteArtsLLC/autolaze/settings/pages so that applications can check that site to get information about what versions of the Autolaze program are available for downloading.
